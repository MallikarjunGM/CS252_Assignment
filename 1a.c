Question number 3.19
A program is to created that takes a command as an argument from
the terminal and display the time it takes to Run the said command.
2 versions of this program should be written, with different method of
IPC.
a) Shared-memory
b) Pipes
This program is the shared memory version.
Part of this code was taken from a solution posted on chegg.com by an
unknown author.
Explainations for functions used for shared memory was taken from
OS Concepts by Silberschatz et.al
